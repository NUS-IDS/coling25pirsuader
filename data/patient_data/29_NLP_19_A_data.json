Adjustments to the dosage may be necessary based on these readings to achieve target blood sugar levels. Additionally, factors such as diet, exercise, and proper insulin injection techniques can influence blood sugar control and should be assessed to ensure the effectiveness of the insulin regimen.', \"Starting insulin does not necessarily signify limited treatment options but represents just one of many treatment strategies available for managing diabetes. Insulin is often suggested when other medications fail to adequately control blood sugar levels. It is perceived as another form of medication akin to oral drugs, aimed at improving blood glucose control and potentially preserving pancreatic function. The decision to start insulin involves considering its benefits, convenience, and the individual's specific medical situation, and should not be seen as an indication that all other treatments have failed.\", \"Blood sugar levels can be managed through dietary changes and exercise rather than relying solely on insulin. Fasting and careful meal planning, including the reduction of sweet and high-carbohydrate foods, can help control glucose levels. Additionally, incorporating regular physical activity and avoiding unhealthy snacks can contribute to better blood sugar management. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary among individuals, and it's important to monitor for any potential risks, such as hypoglycemia.\"]"}
