Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and smoking can impact blood sugar control. Ensuring correct insulin injection techniques and making necessary lifestyle adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control.', 'Insulin, like other diabetes medications, can cause hypoglycemia, which is a condition where blood sugar levels fall too low. Hypoglycemia can be dangerous and may present symptoms such as shaking, sweating, fainting, and confusion.
