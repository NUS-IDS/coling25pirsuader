Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and smoking can impact blood sugar control. Ensuring correct insulin injection techniques and making necessary lifestyle adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control.', 'Managing insulin injections while traveling has become more practical due to advancements such as insulin pens, which can be stored at room temperature for up to a month. This alleviates the need for refrigeration, making it easier to handle insulin while on the go. Travelers no longer need to rely on finding fridges or worry about insulin spoiling in tropical climates.', \"To ensure insulin and other medications do not harm the kidneys, it is crucial to understand that uncontrolled diabetes can damage the kidneys more than the medications themselves. Proper management of blood sugar levels through medication, diet, and lifestyle changes is essential. Regular monitoring of blood sugar and kidney function through lab tests can help in early detection and management of potential issues. It's also important to follow the prescribed medication regimen and consult healthcare providers for any concerns or adjustments needed.\"]"}
