Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and smoking can impact blood sugar control. Ensuring correct insulin injection techniques and making necessary lifestyle adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control.', 'Diet and lifestyle changes can lead to improvements in blood sugar levels, as evidenced by a reduction in measurements. However, these changes alone may not always be sufficient to reach target levels, and additional medical intervention, such as increased medication, might be necessary to achieve optimal blood sugar control.', \"High blood sugar levels despite using insulin may indicate that the insulin is not effectively controlling the blood sugar. This ineffectiveness could be due to insufficient doses of insulin or the body's increased resistance to insulin. Monitoring and adjusting the insulin dosage, as well as ensuring consistent medication adherence, are important steps in managing these high levels.\"]"}
