Travelers no longer need to rely on finding fridges or worry about insulin spoiling in tropical climates.', 'Insulin is relatively affordable nowadays, with costs around $16 per pen, depending on the dosage required. A pen typically lasts about a month. Financial assistance programs may be available to help mitigate costs, and patients are encouraged to discuss these options with their healthcare providers.', \"Insulin's side effects can include weight gain and potential hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), but it generally helps in reducing blood sugar levels and can alleviate stress on the kidneys. Compared to oral medications like Dapagliflozin, which can cause hypotension (low blood pressure) and a risk of urinary tract infections, insulin is often more effective and sometimes cheaper. However, patients might be hesitant due to the need for injections.\"]"}
