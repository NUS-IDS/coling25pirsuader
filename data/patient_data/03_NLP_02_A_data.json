However, this approach carries risks, such as worsening of the condition and the potential development of complications. It is essential to monitor the situation closely and consider insulin therapy if blood sugar levels remain high despite other treatments.', 'To adapt an insulin regimen to fit irregular meal patterns and a busy work schedule, it is important to focus on strategies such as adjusting medication timing, ensuring regular meal intake, and possibly using more convenient forms of insulin like insulin pens. Setting aside even a brief period during work hours to eat and considering packing meals can help maintain consistent blood sugar levels. Regular monitoring and feedback between the patient and healthcare provider are crucial to making necessary adjustments and ensuring effective diabetes management.', \"Before considering insulin, oral medications and dosage adjustments can be options for managing diabetes. These medications work in various ways to control blood sugar levels, such as increasing insulin production, reducing glucose absorption, or enhancing the body's sensitivity to insulin. If these oral treatments are not sufficiently effective, insulin therapy may be introduced while adjusting or discontinuing some of the oral medications. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are also essential components of diabetes management.\"]"}
