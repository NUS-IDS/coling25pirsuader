To monitor the impact of diabetes on kidney health, regular blood pressure checks and urine tests for protein levels are essential. It's also critical to consistently take prescribed diabetes medication to keep blood sugar levels under control and prevent further kidney damage.\", 'Blood sugar levels may remain high despite insulin use due to issues with proper insulin administration, such as incorrect dosage or malfunctioning delivery devices. Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and smoking can impact blood sugar control. Ensuring correct insulin injection techniques and making necessary lifestyle adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control.', 'Insulin administration for individuals with busy or irregular schedules can be managed effectively by opting for a regimen that requires fewer injections, such as a single dose at bedtime. This approach minimizes the need to carry insulin while on the go and helps maintain consistent blood glucose levels. Additionally, close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustments to oral medications can further support effective diabetes management. Regular follow-ups and communication with healthcare providers are also essential to address any issues promptly.']"}
