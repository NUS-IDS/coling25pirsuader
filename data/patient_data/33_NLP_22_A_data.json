Monitoring blood sugar levels at home with a glucose meter can help individuals keep track of their levels and make necessary adjustments. Education on insulin administration and reassurance about the process can also alleviate concerns.', 'Hypoglycemic attacks in patients on insulin can be managed by ensuring they take their medication correctly, such as taking insulin or other glucose-lowering medications at the appropriate times relative to meals. Patients should avoid skipping meals and instead consume small, regular meals to prevent blood sugar levels from dropping too low. Monitoring blood sugar levels regularly and adjusting diet and physical activity to ensure stable glucose levels are also crucial. Education on recognizing symptoms of hypoglycemia and having quick sources of glucose available for immediate consumption when symptoms arise can help manage and mitigate the attacks effectively.', 'Managing insulin therapy can be complex and inconvenient due to the need for regular monitoring of blood glucose levels, adjustments in medication dosages, and the potential for complications such as hypoglycemia. Patients often require education and support to understand how to administer insulin properly and to manage their diet and lifestyle. Additionally, multiple medications for coexisting conditions, like kidney disease, can add to the complexity of the treatment regimen.']"}
