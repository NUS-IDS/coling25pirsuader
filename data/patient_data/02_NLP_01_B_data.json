However, these changes alone may not always be sufficient to reach target levels, and additional medical intervention, such as increased medication, might be necessary to achieve optimal blood sugar control.', 'Before starting insulin injections, other options such as modifying the diet, increasing physical activity, and adjusting the dosage of existing medications can be explored.
