They consistently affirm taking their medication daily and report no significant issues with it. However, their control over diabetes is suboptimal, as indicated by high sugar levels. The patient is reluctant to adopt insulin therapy, citing fear based on their mother's adverse experience. Although the patient doesn\u2019t check their blood pressure or blood sugar levels at home due to lack of equipment, they rely on their daughter for information and support.

Education about the effectiveness of insulin and dispelling myths or fears surrounding its use can help in this regard. Emphasizing the importance of proactive management and regular monitoring can encourage better adherence to recommended treatments.\", 'Addressing the fear of insulin injections involves educating patients about the process and dispelling common misconceptions. Highlighting that the pain from insulin injections is often less than that from routine finger pricks can alleviate anxiety. Demonstrating the use of fine needles and explaining the benefits of insulin in controlling diabetes can also help. Patients should be reassured that they have options and can discuss their concerns with healthcare providers to find the best approach for their treatment.', 'The patient feels generally positive about their blood sugar and blood pressure monitoring. They report no significant problems and regularly check their blood sugar levels, although they do not consistently keep records. Their blood pressure is stable. They follow dietary control and engage in regular exercise. Overall, they are cooperative with the suggested monitoring routines and adjustments.']"}
