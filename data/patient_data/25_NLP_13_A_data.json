Insulin is often suggested when other medications fail to adequately control blood sugar levels. It is perceived as another form of medication akin to oral drugs, aimed at improving blood glucose control and potentially preserving pancreatic function. The decision to start insulin involves considering its benefits, convenience, and the individual's specific medical situation, and should not be seen as an indication that all other treatments have failed.\", 'Managing blood sugar levels around 10 mmol/L through lifestyle changes alone can be challenging, especially if previous lifestyle modifications have been ineffective. While some individuals may prefer to adjust their diet and increase exercise before considering insulin, it is crucial to monitor blood sugar levels closely. Persistent high levels can lead to serious health complications, so a combination of lifestyle changes and medication might be necessary to achieve optimal control. Regular follow-ups and adjustments to the treatment plan are essential to prevent further health issues.']"}
