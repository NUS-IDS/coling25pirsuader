If blood sugar levels remain high despite these measures, switching to insulin might be necessary to achieve better glycemic control. Insulin can effectively lower blood sugar levels when other medications fail to do so.', 'To remember to take insulin injections consistently, consider integrating the injections into your daily routine, such as taking them at the same time each day, possibly aligned with a regular activity like brushing your teeth. Keeping your medication and supplies easily accessible and visible can serve as a reminder. Using tools such as alarms, reminders on your phone, or even a dedicated app can help ensure you don\u2019t forget. In cases where routine disruptions are expected, carrying your medication with you can provide the flexibility to take it as needed.', \"Blood sugar levels can be managed through dietary changes and exercise rather than relying solely on insulin. Fasting and careful meal planning, including the reduction of sweet and high-carbohydrate foods, can help control glucose levels. Additionally, incorporating regular physical activity and avoiding unhealthy snacks can contribute to better blood sugar management. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary among individuals, and it's important to monitor for any potential risks, such as hypoglycemia.\"]"}
