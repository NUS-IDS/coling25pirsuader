There is a rapport between the patient and the doctor, highlighted by humor and mutual respect.

To monitor the impact of diabetes on kidney health, regular blood pressure checks and urine tests for protein levels are essential. It's also critical to consistently take prescribed diabetes medication to keep blood sugar levels under control and prevent further kidney damage.\", 'Diet and lifestyle changes can lead to improvements in blood sugar levels, as evidenced by a reduction in measurements. However, these changes alone may not always be sufficient to reach target levels, and additional medical intervention, such as increased medication, might be necessary to achieve optimal blood sugar control.']"}
