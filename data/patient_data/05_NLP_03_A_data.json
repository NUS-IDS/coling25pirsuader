Some patients may be able to stop using insulin if their condition improves significantly through lifestyle changes or other treatments. The need for insulin can vary based on individual circumstances, and it is possible for some patients to transition back to oral medications or manage their diabetes without medication if their condition stabilizes.', 'The costs of insulin therapy can vary, but generally, it includes the price of the insulin pens, which might be around $10 to $15 per pen, sufficient for about one month of use. Additional expenses may include consumables such as needles and alcohol swabs. However, these costs can often be offset through healthcare savings plans like Medisave. Despite concerns about the price, insulin therapy is usually considered cost-effective compared to alternative treatment options while providing better glycemic control.', \"Insulin is highly effective in managing diabetes, especially when oral medications are insufficient. It helps to replace or supplement the body's insulin, which is crucial for lowering blood sugar levels. Insulin therapy can significantly reduce complications associated with diabetes, such as vision problems, fatigue, and poor wound healing. Modern insulin delivery methods, such as insulin pens, make administration more convenient and less painful. The effectiveness of insulin often allows for a reduction in oral medications once blood sugar levels are stabilized.\"]"}
