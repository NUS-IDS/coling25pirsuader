The primary benefit is improved blood sugar management, which can help prevent complications associated with diabetes. However, potential side effects include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), weight gain, and the inconvenience of injections. Insulin therapy might also necessitate adjustments in oral medications and lifestyle changes. It is crucial for patients to be closely monitored and educated about the proper use of insulin to mitigate risks and enhance its efficacy.', \"To ensure insulin and other medications do not harm the kidneys, it is crucial to understand that uncontrolled diabetes can damage the kidneys more than the medications themselves. Proper management of blood sugar levels through medication, diet, and lifestyle changes is essential. Regular monitoring of blood sugar and kidney function through lab tests can help in early detection and management of potential issues. It's also important to follow the prescribed medication regimen and consult healthcare providers for any concerns or adjustments needed.\", 'The risk of low blood sugar levels while on insulin can be managed by eating regularly and injecting insulin at the correct times. Proper adherence to medication schedules and monitoring blood sugar levels are crucial to avoid hypoglycemia. Adjusting medication types and dosages can also help mitigate side effects such as diarrhea.']"}
