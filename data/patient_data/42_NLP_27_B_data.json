If blood sugar levels remain high despite these measures, switching to insulin might be necessary to achieve better glycemic control. Insulin can effectively lower blood sugar levels when other medications fail to do so.', \"To manage insulin with irregular working hours and sleep patterns, it's important to establish a consistent routine for insulin injections. This can be achieved by selecting a specific time each night for the injection, such as before bedtime, regardless of meal times. Basal insulin, which is long-acting, can be administered at the same time daily without the necessity of eating, helping to stabilize blood sugar levels overnight.\", \"When oral medications are insufficient in managing diabetes, delaying insulin can be risky. It's important to consider starting insulin to control blood sugar levels effectively and prevent complications. If oral medications have reached their maximum dosage and blood sugar levels remain high, insulin therapy should be seriously considered to ensure optimal management of diabetes.\"]"}
