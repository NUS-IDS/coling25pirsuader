The three-month average plasma glucose concentration has significantly decreased from a higher level to a much lower, more controlled level. This suggests that the adjustments in medication dosage have positively impacted glycemic control.', 'Diet and exercise can significantly improve blood sugar levels and may help avoid the need for insulin. However, in some cases where blood sugar levels are extremely high or not well-managed through lifestyle changes alone, insulin might still be necessary. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on medical advice are crucial.', 'The risk of low blood sugar levels while on insulin can be managed by eating regularly and injecting insulin at the correct times. Proper adherence to medication schedules and monitoring blood sugar levels are crucial to avoid hypoglycemia. Adjusting medication types and dosages can also help mitigate side effects such as diarrhea.']"}
