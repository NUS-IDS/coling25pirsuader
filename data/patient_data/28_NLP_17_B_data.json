Lifestyle changes such as improved diet, exercise, and weight loss are also critical components. If oral medications and lifestyle adjustments are insufficient, transitioning to insulin may be considered to better control blood sugar levels and prevent complications.', 'Diabetes management often involves a combination of medication, diet, and exercise. However, consistent diet and exercise can significantly improve blood sugar levels and reduce the need for medication in some cases. Achieving good control of blood sugar through lifestyle changes can lead to stable diabetes management, though completely discontinuing medication is difficult and varies by individual. Regular physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, and a balanced diet low in high-sugar foods are beneficial for managing diabetes.', \"To address the belief of adequate diabetes management despite high sugar levels, it's essential to communicate the risks associated with consistently high glucose readings and the long-term complications that can arise. Education about the effectiveness of insulin and dispelling myths or fears surrounding its use can help in this regard. Emphasizing the importance of proactive management and regular monitoring can encourage better adherence to recommended treatments.\"]"}
