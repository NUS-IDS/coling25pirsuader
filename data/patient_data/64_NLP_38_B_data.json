Lifestyle changes such as improved diet, exercise, and weight loss are also critical components. If oral medications and lifestyle adjustments are insufficient, transitioning to insulin may be considered to better control blood sugar levels and prevent complications.', 'Diet and lifestyle changes can lead to improvements in blood sugar levels, as evidenced by a reduction in measurements. However, these changes alone may not always be sufficient to reach target levels, and additional medical intervention, such as increased medication, might be necessary to achieve optimal blood sugar control.']"}
