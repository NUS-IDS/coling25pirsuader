Insulin, a common treatment for diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels and increases the risk of hypoglycemia, which may subsequently cause dizziness and falls if blood sugar drops too low. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood sugar levels and symptoms is essential to mitigate these risks.', 'To prevent swelling at insulin injection sites, rotate the injection sites regularly. Avoid injecting into the same spot repeatedly to reduce the risk of localized swelling.', 'To address aversion to medical procedures and visits, it is important to provide thorough explanations about the necessity and benefits of treatments, ensuring patients understand their conditions and the reasons behind medical recommendations. Establishing trust and open communication between healthcare providers and patients can help alleviate fears and concerns. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and managing chronic conditions and offering reassurance about the manageability of minor discomforts can encourage patients to adhere to their medical routines.']"}
