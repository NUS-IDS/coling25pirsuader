The aim is typically to achieve fasting blood sugar levels between 4 to 7 mmol/L. Increasing the insulin dosage slightly and incorporating lifestyle changes like regular exercise and dietary adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control. Monitoring blood sugar levels more frequently, including after meals, can provide additional insights for managing diabetes effectively.', \"For individuals with infrequent meals, an insulin regimen can be adjusted by focusing on taking insulin with whatever food is consumed, even if it's just a small amount like bread. It may also involve reducing the dosage to match the reduced food intake. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on blood sugar levels are crucial to maintain effective diabetes management. Additionally, alternative diabetes medications or combination therapies may be considered to align better with the person's eating habits and lifestyle.\", 'Consistency with medication and diet is crucial in diabetes management. Regular intake of prescribed medications and adherence to dietary guidelines significantly impact blood sugar levels and overall health. Inconsistent medication use and lapses in diet can lead to poor control of diabetes, increasing the risk of complications such as heart disease, kidney issues, and nerve damage. Effective diabetes management often requires a combination of medication, diet, and lifestyle changes.']"}
