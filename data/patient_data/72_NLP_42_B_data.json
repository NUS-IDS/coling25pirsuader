Despite his diabetes diagnosis, he does not take his medication regularly and prefers cheaper options like Metformin. He expresses concerns about his kidneys and fears the side effects of his medications, which contributes to his inconsistent adherence. The patient also works as a security guard and feels relatively healthy, which might contribute to his casual attitude towards strict diabetes management.

To monitor the impact of diabetes on kidney health, regular blood pressure checks and urine tests for protein levels are essential. It's also critical to consistently take prescribed diabetes medication to keep blood sugar levels under control and prevent further kidney damage.\", 'Insulin can be more cost-effective compared to some other diabetes medications. While drugs like Metformin and Gliclazide are generally affordable, others like Januvia (Sitagliptin) are significantly more expensive. Transitioning to insulin may reduce the need for these costly medications, leading to overall cost savings despite the added expense of insulin itself. However, insulin also has drawbacks, such as potential weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia.', \"If a patient prefers to stick with their current medication regimen, it is not strictly necessary to change medications. However, if their condition is not well-controlled, adjustments may be necessary to achieve better health outcomes and prevent complications. This could involve either increasing the dosage of current medications or considering alternative treatments, such as insulin for diabetes management. It's important for patients to understand the potential risks of not making adjustments and to work closely with their healthcare provider to find the best course of action.\"]"}
