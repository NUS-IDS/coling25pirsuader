Increasing the insulin dosage slightly and incorporating lifestyle changes like regular exercise and dietary adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control. Monitoring blood sugar levels more frequently, including after meals, can provide additional insights for managing diabetes effectively.', \"To address the belief of adequate diabetes management despite high sugar levels, it's essential to communicate the risks associated with consistently high glucose readings and the long-term complications that can arise. Education about the effectiveness of insulin and dispelling myths or fears surrounding its use can help in this regard.
