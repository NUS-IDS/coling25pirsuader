However, as diabetes progresses, the pancreas may deteriorate and produce less insulin, eventually necessitating the use of injected insulin to maintain blood sugar levels. While lifestyle changes and diet can help improve blood sugar control, they may not always be sufficient to manage the condition as it advances. Therefore, insulin or other medications might be required to prevent complications associated with diabetes.', 'The ongoing costs of insulin therapy include the cost of the insulin itself, which may be lower due to heavy subsidies, and the consumables such as needle heads. The insulin is typically administered using insulin pens that can last a month at room temperature, even in tropical climates, enhancing convenience. Financial assistance schemes may be available to help offset the costs of consumables for individuals facing financial difficulties.', 'Adjustments are often necessary if blood sugar levels are around 8.3 mmol/L to meet target ranges. The aim is typically to achieve fasting blood sugar levels between 4 to 7 mmol/L. Increasing the insulin dosage slightly and incorporating lifestyle changes like regular exercise and dietary adjustments can help achieve better glycemic control. Monitoring blood sugar levels more frequently, including after meals, can provide additional insights for managing diabetes effectively.']"}
