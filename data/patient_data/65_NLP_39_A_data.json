However, consistency in taking prescribed medications is also crucial for effective diabetes management. Insulin therapy may still be necessary if dietary adjustments and oral medications are not enough to maintain optimal blood sugar levels.', 'To manage exercise with a sedentary job and irregular schedule, aim to incorporate physical activity into daily routines by setting realistic goals. Start with shorter sessions, like 30 minutes a day, five days a week, and gradually increase to longer durations. Utilize any available time, such as breaks or weekends, for activities like walking.
