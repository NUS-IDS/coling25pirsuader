Diabetes treatments vary in their mechanisms and individual responses, meaning if one medication is ineffective, others may still be beneficial. Insulin, specifically, directly supplements the body's natural insulin production and can be effective where other medications are not.\", \"Starting insulin therapy may not be immediately necessary if HbA1c levels have significantly improved and diabetes management shows good progress. However, it remains an option for the future if diabetes control worsens. Continuous monitoring of blood sugar levels, adherence to medication, regular meals, and lifestyle adjustments are crucial for maintaining optimal diabetic control. The decision to start insulin should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition and the potential benefits and risks of insulin therapy.\"]"}
