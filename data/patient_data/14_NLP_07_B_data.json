The primary benefit is improved blood sugar management, which can help prevent complications associated with diabetes. However, potential side effects include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), weight gain, and the inconvenience of injections. Insulin therapy might also necessitate adjustments in oral medications and lifestyle changes.
